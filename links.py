VERY HIGH LEVEL. I'd recommend picking one that you are interested in and learning about it specifically rather than trying to learn everything.
Key topics include:
- Neural Networks (there are a LOT of different types of neural network)
- Regression (Logistical / Linear etc)
- Clustering algorithms (K nearest neighbours / DBSCAN etc)
