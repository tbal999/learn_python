Test 2 - Functions & Conditionals

For this test there is an easier function, and a more challenging function.
The challenging one is optional.
"""

#BEGIN
def isEven(number):
    """
    Make this function confirm whether or not the 5 numbers 
    below are even or not. Should print "True" for even, "False" for odd.
    
    Hint:
        The modulus operator (%) confirms what value is left behind when
        a number is divided by another number.
        for example: 5 % 2 = 1.
    """
    
isEven(1) #False
isEven(2) #True
isEven(3) #False
isEven(4) #True
isEven(5) #False

#CHALLENGE 
def guessGame(number):
    """
    Create a guessing game, where somebody has to repeatedly input a number
    between 1 and 10 until they get the right answer.
    
    If the intial number is below 1 or over 10 - it should say:
        "Number must be between 1 and 10!"
        
    Otherwise, it should begin the game. 
    This can be done using a recursive function only, no loops are needed.
    """

guessGame(11) # "Number must be between 1 and 10!"
guessGame(5) # Game starts.
