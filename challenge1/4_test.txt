"""
This test will verify your understanding of some basic data structures (lists and dictionaries)
as well as previous taught content.

Section 1:
You need to create a simple to-do class that lets you:
    1) Add a task to the end of list
    2) Remove a task from list
    3) Print out all the tasks you have added so far.
    
    
Section 2:
    What if a task has many subtasks in it? I.E
    'Morning walk: have a coffee, go to local co-op, walk to park'
    
    We could call this a 'multitask'.
    It's name would be 'Morning walk'
    and it has three tasks within it:
        "have a coffee"
        "go to local co-op"
        "walk to park"
        
    Add this extra functionality:
    1) Add a multitask
    2) Remove a multitask
    3) Add a task to the end of a multitask
    4) remove a task from a multitask
    5) print out one multitask's tasks (a list of all the tasks within one multitask)
    6) print out all multitasks (name of the multitasks only)
    
"""

class todo:
    tasklist = [] #This is a 1D list and will be used for the task section.
    multitasklist = {} #This is a 1D dictionary and will be used for the multitask section.
    """
    Hint - the dictionary should look something like this {"Multitask", [List of tasks]}.
    i.e:
    
    {'Multitask 1': ['Task1','task2','task3'],
     'Multitask 2': ['Task1','task2','task3']}
    
    so in this example, to access multitask1 it would be "multitasklist['Multitask 1']".
    and to print out Task1 in multitask1 it would be like "multitasklist['Multitask 1']['Task1']".
