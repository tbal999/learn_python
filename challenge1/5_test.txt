"""
This test will test your understanding of loops.

In old ASCII sidescrolling video games, objects could be drawn
on the map using loops.
Below you will draw out two objects.

Challenge 1:
    Print this triangle in console using a loop:
        
    #
    ##
    ###
    ####
    #####
    
Challenge 2:
    Print this triangle in console using a loop:
        
        #
       ###
      #####
     #######
    #########
        
Use anything at your disposal! 
Preferably though, solve this using loops.
