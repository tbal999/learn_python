"""
If you successfully complete all tests, you have demonstrated a basic understanding of the language.

From here, if you want to keep doing data analysis and automation with python, I recommend learning more about the Pandas package online.
Here's the API ref site for pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html
There will be specific pandas python training which I am designing at the moment.

Final challenge - Packages.

THE CHALLENGE:
Using everything you have learned so far, create a python script that does the below:
    
    1) Copies the 3 most recently modified files in one folder and places a copy of them
        in another folder.
    
    2) You can use any source and destination filepath. And there must be more than three files in the source folder. They can be any file type.
    
You can use everything you have learned (as well as google ofc!) to solve this one.
There are many many different ways to solve this (this is the pythonic way).
Some are more efficient than others, but at this level who cares.
I recommend you use packages!


Example output...

Most recent files: 
file1.file
file2.file
file3.file
copied from sourcefolder 
copied to destinationfolder
