"""
This test will verify your understanding of classes, as well
as include previous concepts you have learned in my previous training materials - functions, variables and conditionals.

You must build a 'calculator' class that lets you create an object that lets you:
    a) add to a number
    b) subtract from a number
    c) multiply a number
    d) divide a number
    e) confirm whether that number is even or not.
    f) confirm whether that number is negative or not
    g) has a 'view' function that lets you view the number i.e print it
"""

class Calculator: #This is the calculator class.
    """
    To help you out, I have already added the methods below (class functions). 
    From here you can build it.
    """
    def __init__(self, number): #Initialises the class with a number
        self.number = number #This is a variable created and stored within the object.
        #To access this variable going forwards, you must type 'self.number'
    
    def add(self, x): #add the number 'x' to the number.
        
    def subtract(self, x): #deduct the number 'x' to the number.
        
    def multiply(self, x): #multiply the number by 'x'.
        
    def divide(self, x): #divide the number by 'x'.
        
    def isEven(self): #is the number even?
        
    def isNegative(self): #is the number < 0?
        
    def view(self): #print out the number.

"""
Output in console should be:
    
    20
    17
    False
    False
