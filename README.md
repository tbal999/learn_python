# learn python
Here I am teaching (very hands-on) the basics of programming using python.

This is designed for data analysts who want to apply Python to their data crunching. Once you've got the basics down, you can use Pandas [a powerful data analysis library]. With a combination of Pandas and SQL drivers / query in Python, you can add a tonne of extra ability to your toolset and massively overshoot other data analysts who don't have Python knowledge. This means you get more £££/$$$ and this is why I created this course.

I find a lot of tutorials drag on when it comes to basic concepts, maybe for good reason, but why not just make it concise?
This is aimed at people who want to absorb stuff quickly and get stuck into something big.
I have created various scripts which teach as you read them. The idea is you can download and run the scripts, but also
you can read the comments and understand how each script works.

You can play around with the results of each script, and build upon each level quickly - at least that's the plan!

Contents:
# Variables
Learn what variables are, what local and global variables are.

# Functions & Conditionals
Learn what functions are, and how to use them with variables
You'll also see conditionals in this section.

# Classes & Objects
Learn what classes are, and how they encapsulate both functions and variables

# Data structures
How do you store things and work with things easily? Data structures! In this section we learn about Dictionaries and Lists.

# Loops & Recursion
Sometimes you want to do the same thing multiple times. Or a different thing every single time.

# Packages
The true magic of python (and many other languages) is packages.
Standing on the shoulders of giants, you can develop sophisticated processes using libraries/packages other people have built.

# Testing
Testing is important - it lets you ensure the behaviour of your code matches what you intend it to be.
It's good to write tests.

# Challenges
I will add these over time. They're bonus challenges if you're getting bored of the content and think you can do more.
The core challenges, if you are on the training course, will be sent to you via email from me.
